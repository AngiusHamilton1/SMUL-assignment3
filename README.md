# Environmental Sound Classification Using CNN and LinearSVC

This project explores advanced methods for environmental sound classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning techniques. The proposed framework leverages weakly labeled web audio data for sound event detection and classification, demonstrating efficiency with variable-length audio samples and achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ESC-50 dataset. 

To further enhance model robustness and generalization, data augmentation techniques such as pitch shifting, time stretching, and noise addition were applied, simulating real-world variations in environmental sound data. A Linear Support Vector Machine (LinearSVC) is employed as the classification method to distinguish between environmental sound categories under diverse conditions effectively.

This repository contains the implementation, feature extraction modules, and all necessary tools for reproducing the results.

## Features
- **Feature Extraction:** Implements a CNN-based feature extractor for audio signals using mel spectrograms.
- **Data Augmentation:** Includes techniques like pitch shifting, time stretching, and noise addition to improve generalization.
- **Classification:** Uses a LinearSVC classifier to achieve high accuracy on the ESC-50 dataset.
- **Cross-Validation:** Supports stratified k-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/AngiusHamilton1/SMUL-assignment3.git)
   cd SMUL-assignment3
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the ESC-50 dataset and place the audio files in the `ESC-50-master/audio` directory and metadata in `ESC-50-master/meta/esc50.csv`.

## Usage

1. Run the main pipeline:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   During execution, you will be prompted to enable data augmentation and cross-validation.

2. Results, including classification reports and metrics, will be displayed in the terminal.
